## Explanatory note

### Task 1

***The solution for this task is [here](https://github.com/anutkaborisenko87/test_task_axisbits/tree/main/task_1)***

To implement the task, such design patterns were applied as:

1. Template Method
2. Strategy
3. Decorator
4. Factory method

- [Here](https://github.com/anutkaborisenko87/test_task_axisbits/tree/main/task_1/baseClasses) are the base classes that
  implement the solution for the task

- [Here](https://github.com/anutkaborisenko87/test_task_axisbits/tree/main/task_1/Tests) are tests to check the performance of the functional

### Task 2

***The solution for this task is [here](https://github.com/anutkaborisenko87/test_task_axisbits/tree/main/task_2)***

To implement the task, such design patterns were applied as:

1. Iterator
2. Strategy

- [Here](https://github.com/anutkaborisenko87/test_task_axisbits/tree/main/task_2/baseClasses) are the base classes that
  implement the solution for the task

- [Here](https://github.com/anutkaborisenko87/test_task_axisbits/tree/main/task_2/Tests) are tests to check the performance of the functional

### Task 3-6

Here you can see examples of my other work. Even though these are just test tasks, they can be used to understand my
approach to completing tasks.
